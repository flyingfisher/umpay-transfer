# node-umpay-transfer
This is an implementation for UMPAY transfer. Same as umpay, this is a private version.

Now the project passed basic test. But it is not fully tested.

This project is write in Typescript 1.4.

File sample.ts is example code. File index.js is the entry.

Api:
```
   Available options:
{
	funCode:"",
	spId:"",
	userId:"",
	host:"",
	port:"",
	verifyRespSign:true,
	desKeyPath:"",
	priKeyPath:"",
	pubKeyPath:""
}
```

P.S. all option can be emitted.

You can open sample.ts to see detail.

I will be pleasure if this helps.
